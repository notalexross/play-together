## Description

An online multiplayer tabletop games simulator, with live messaging, user presence tracking, and an interesting troll element. Any connected user can switch out the playing board, move pieces around, and change the size and/or colour of pieces. Even players not involved in the current game can join in and start interfering if they so desire. All that is needed is a link to the game room, easily copied by clicking the shareable link at the top of the page, and they can start trolling immediatelyâ€”no login required.
